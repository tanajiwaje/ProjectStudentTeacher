___________________Designing the ASP.NET WebAPI Project__________________
Create an ASP.NET WebAPI project that serves as the backend for your application.
Design API controllers to handle various functionalities such as managing courses, students, teachers, and administration.
Organize the project by creating separate areas for different user roles, e.g., Admin, Student, Teacher.
In each module (area), define views and action methods as per your project's requirements.

_________________Frontend Development__________________________________
Utilize HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design the user interface for your application.
Consume the APIs using AJAX technology with jQuery to perform CRUD operations. For example, you can use AJAX calls to fetch and display data, 
create new records, update existing records, and delete records.

________________________-ProjectOperationService Class Library__________________________________
Create a class library project, named "ProjectOperationService," that handles the business logic of your application.
Inside this library, create repositories that interact with the database. These repositories can be responsible for data retrieval and storage.
Within the "Service" folder of the library, design and implement methods that your application needs for performing CRUD operations and other functionalities. 
These methods should be related to the specific modules and can include operations like adding a new student, listing all teachers, updating a course, etc.
Ensure that these methods are properly documented with descriptions that explain their purpose and usage.
